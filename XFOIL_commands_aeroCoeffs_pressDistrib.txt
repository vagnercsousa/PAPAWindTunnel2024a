The airfoil aerodynamic data presented in the article were obtained by using XFOIL with the typical commands sequence below (MATLAB scripts were used to read data files and generate figures).

- XFOIL can be obtained from http://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/

- download, unzip and start XFOIL executable from the command line

- follow the general command sequence below (modify parameters as needed):


XFOIL c>

	NACA 0012

	OPER

.OPERi c>

	MACH 0.02

	RE 1E5

	ALFA 0 (or other angle values)

	CPWR result_x_Cp_alfa00_invisc.dat

	(press enter / return)

XFOIL c>

	SAVE airf_NACA0012_coords.dat

	PLOP

Option, Value c>

	(adjust object and page dimensions if needed)

	(press enter / return)

XFOIL c>

	OPER

.OPERi c>

	HARD

	(create a file named "plot.ps" in the Xfoil folder; the file is appended by default, so we usually need to exit Xfoil for the file to be properly saved)

	(press enter / return)

XFOIL c>

	QUIT

	(file "plot.ps" is now properly closed; now you can rename it to ".EPS" to use in LaTex documents)


- repeat the major steps above for other parameters (such as different angle values);

- use VISC (under OPER) to consider viscous effects (such as separation bubbles);

- use CPx or CPV (under OPER) to plot a graph with pressure coefficient or an airfoil with arrows;

- for the user convenience, MATLAB scripts to read saved data files and generate figures are also available along with this instructions (see "f_XFoil_ReadTxt.m" and "f_XFoil_ReadTxt_Cp.m").
